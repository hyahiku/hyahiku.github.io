### 🌎 Climate Profile Segmentation & Retrieval
> Unsupervised ML · NLP · RAG-Inspired Retrieval · Brazil Municipal Data

K-Means clustering segments 5,500+ Brazilian municipalities into four distinct climate profiles based on temperature, humidity, precipitation, and solar radiation. A hybrid retrieval system allows natural language queries — combining structured filtering with semantic ranking to outperform semantic-only approaches.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Dataset** | ~3.5M weekly climate observations · Hugging Face |
| **Key Result** | 4 climate profiles identified · hybrid retrieval significantly outperformed semantic-only baseline |

**Top Stack:** `K-Means` `sentence-transformers` `StandardScaler` `cosine similarity` `plotly`

### 🛒 Amazon Beauty Review Complaint Analysis
> NLP · K-Means Clustering · E-Commerce · Text Classification

NLP preprocessing and K-Means clustering surface and quantify the primary drivers of customer dissatisfaction across 700K+ Amazon beauty reviews. Quality, color, and performance issues account for over 64% of all complaint drivers — providing actionable signals for product development and listing optimization.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Dataset** | 701,528 Amazon beauty reviews · Hugging Face |
| **Key Result** | 6 quantified complaint categories · Quality Issues = 26.4% of all complaints |

**Top Stack:** `NLP` `NLTK` `spaCy` `K-Means` `TF-IDF` `PySpark` `wordcloud`

### 🧺 Online Retail Market Basket Analysis
> Association Rules · TF-IDF · K-Means · Retail Analytics

Apriori algorithm mines 18,536 transaction baskets for 275 association rules. Quantity bins extend co-occurrence analysis to capture purchase intensity. TF-IDF + K-Means clusters products into 5 thematic categories by item description linguistics.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Dataset** | ~400K transactions · UCI Machine Learning Repository (Dec 2010 – Dec 2011) |
| **Key Result** | 275 association rules · pink/green plate co-occurrence lift = 61.9× · 5 product clusters |

**Top Stack:** `Apriori (mlxtend)` `TfidfVectorizer` `K-Means` `association rules` `PySpark`

### 💰 Income & Asset Value Risk Behavior Analysis
> Hypothesis Testing · T-Test · ANOVA · Financial Analytics

Investigates whether income level is a statistically significant predictor of asset accumulation using independent t-test and one-way ANOVA across binary and quartile income groupings. Both tests reject the null hypothesis with p-values well below 0.05.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Dataset** | Risk Behavior Features · Kaggle |
| **Key Result** | t = 2.894, p = 0.005 · F = 4.833, p = 0.0041 · H₀ rejected in both tests |

**Top Stack:** `scipy.stats` `t-test` `one-way ANOVA` `EDA` `seaborn` `matplotlib`

### 🏠 Airbnb Exploratory Analysis
> EDA · Linear Regression · Hypothesis-Driven Analysis · NYC Listings

Investigates whether host flexibility (cancellation policy, instant booking, minimum nights) correlates with rental popularity across 99,729 cleaned NYC Airbnb listings. Side-by-side comparison of 5-star vs. non 5-star renters. Surprising null result — flexibility shows no meaningful correlation with rating.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Dataset** | 102,599 NYC Airbnb listings · insideairbnb.com |
| **Key Result** | No correlation between flexibility and rating · strong price/service fee linear relationship identified |

**Top Stack:** `pandas` `seaborn` `matplotlib` `linear regression` `IQR outlier detection` `EDA`
